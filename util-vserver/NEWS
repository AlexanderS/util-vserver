Version 0.24
============

	- updated to new syscall API (patch c17h and later)
	
	- revived copy-all-mode for 'vserver ... build' (can be disabled
	  with $UTIL_VSERVER_AVOID_COPY)

	- use '-HS' ulimit switch for newly created vservers

	- added QUOTACTL capability, removed OPENDEV capability

	- location of vservers-rootdir can now be configured through a
	  '--with-vrootdir' configure switch; it defaults still to
	  '/vservers'

	- build of 'newvserver' linuxconf-module is conditionalized since
	  it is unsupported and will be dropped in future versions. To
	  enable it. call './configure' with '--enable-linuxconf'.
