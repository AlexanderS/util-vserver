Version 0.25
============

	- BUGFIX: this version fixes handling of ctx >= 32768

	- experimental support for new resource-limit syscall was add
	  (vserver >= 1.1.3); the new 'vlimit' tool replaces 'setctxlimit'

	- some man-pages were added and init-scripts improved (taken from
	  Debian patches provided by Sam Vilain)

	- basic Gentoo support was added to the 'vserver' script (thanks to
	  "Allen D. Parker II")

	- compilation fixes for kernel 2.6 headers

	- set mode/owner of /var/run/utmp (owner is customizable through
	  $UTMP_GROUP)

	
Version 0.24
============

	- updated to new syscall API (patch c17h and later)
	
	- revived copy-all-mode for 'vserver ... build' (can be disabled
	  with $UTIL_VSERVER_AVOID_COPY)

	- use '-HS' ulimit switch for newly created vservers

	- added QUOTACTL capability, removed OPENDEV capability

	- location of vservers-rootdir can now be configured through a
	  '--with-vrootdir' configure switch; it defaults still to
	  '/vservers'

	- build of 'newvserver' linuxconf-module is conditionalized since
	  it is unsupported and will be dropped in future versions. To
	  enable it. call './configure' with '--enable-linuxconf'.
