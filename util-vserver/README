Some common notes/FAQs:
======================

* when vserver startup/shutdown fails, or when you get

  | Error: /proc must be mounted

  errors, make sure, that 'vprocunhide' was executed. When installing
  'util-vserver' with packagemanagement, an appropriate initscript
  should be installed

* the name of old-style vservers is shown on 2.4 kernels only; the
  needed functionality is not implemented for 2.6 kernels.



Some distribution specific notes:
=================================

Red Hat 7.3, Red Hat 9, Fedora Core 1&2
---------------------------------------
* tested and running successfully as host and guest systems

* it is *strongly* suggested to use the rpm packages which can be
  created from the tarball with

  | $ rpmbuild -tb util-vserver-<version>.tar.bz2

  For distributions below Fedora Core 2, additional

  | --without dietlibc --without xalan

  flags are required for the 'rpmbuild' command. Builds on Red Hat 7.3
  will require a

  | --nodeps

  also, since 'vconfig' is not available there. Since it is required
  for path-detection only and paths from RH systems will be assumed by
  default, this should not be a big problem.

* guest systems can be created with the 'apt-rpm' build-method. This
  requires the 'apt' package e.g. from http://fedora.us. Before first
  invocation, a near mirror should be activated in

  | /etc/vservers/.distributions/<id>/apt/sources.list

  (To avoid slashdotting by the masses of util-vserver-users, there
  does not exist a standard mirror)

* RH/FC uses the 'sysv' initstyle which is assumed by default

* when having existing vservers with RH 9 or Fedora Core 1, the startup
  of the vserver will probably fail. You will have to add

  | true

  to etc/rc.d/rc (within the vserver root directory)

* when having RH/FC guestsystems, it is *strongly* recommended to use
  a dietlibc linked version of 'rpm-fake-resolver'. Else, package
  installation with 'vrpm' or 'vapt-get' can fail since users can not
  be resolved.



Debian Woody & Sarge
--------------------
* tested and running successfully as guest systems on FC1/FC2 hosts

* guest systems can be created with the 'debootstrap' method. When
  not already existing, the needed package will be downloaded
  automatically.  Since it is updated very often, it can happen
  that a '404 Not found' error occurs; in this case look either
  for a newer util-vserver package, or configure the new URI e.g. with

  | echo 'http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/d/debootstrap/debootstrap_<version>_i386.deb' \
  |    >/etc/vservers/.defaults/apps/debootstrap/uri

  You can download a local copy of this tarball also, and register it
  with

  | echo '/<path-to-the-tarball>' \
  |    >/etc/vservers/.defaults/apps/debootstrap/uri

* it is known, that warning messages will be created at startup and
  shutdown of guest servers. This is non fatal and can be ignored

* Debian guest systems are running fine with the 'sysv' initstyle;
  success with 'plain' was reported also

* no packages for Debian hosts are known at time of writing (May 2004)



Gentoo
------
* Gentoo guest systems are very complicated and are requiring lots of
  modifications in the initscripts. Currently, no step-by-step guide
  can be provided

* 'sysv' initstyle is probably not working for Gentoo guests (e.g. you
  will see messages about missing 'utmp' files); 'gentoo' should be
  used instead of:

  | echo 'gentoo' >/etc/vservers/<id>/apps/init/style

* there does not exist a build-method for Gentoo guests; instead of,
  create a skeleton with

  | # vserver <id> build -m skeleton --initstyle gentoo <other-opts>*

  and fill the vserver directory at /etc/vservers/<id>/vdir/ manually.
