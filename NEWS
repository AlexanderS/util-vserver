version 0.30.210
================

	- LEGACY BREAKAGE: by default, only recent kernel APIs will be
	supported so you have to make sure to use at least the vs2.0.1
	kernel patch. With older kernels, you have to call 'configure'
	with '--enable-apis=NOLEGACY'. Some programs will not work anymore
	with the default settings; these ones are:

	     + capchroot
	     * chcontext-context
	     * reducecap

	- dlimit support was integrated into the standard vserver
	operations. Thanks to Daniel Hokka Zakrisson for his patch.

	- recent kernel API is now used for setting up the network
	contexts. So it should be now possible to use a kernel compiled
	without CONFIG_VSERVER_LEGACYNET. Thanks to Daniel Hokka Zakrisson
	for his patch.  .


version 0.30.209
================

	- large revamping...
	
	
version 0.23.6
